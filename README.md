# Abstract
Blockchain technology has a huge potential for the
development of financial and many other industries. One of the main
advantages of the technology is the exclusive ownership and
instantaneous transmission within the network. However, in reality
there is no connection between the ownership of the network and any
objects in the real world. As a result, most ordinary Internet users lack
the interest and need to learn and use Blockchain technology in
everyday life. We offer a non-standard solution using augmented
reality to create and visualize Blockchain property objects in the real
world and their further monetization. An area for visualizing objects in
the real world, an open celestial GEO-space is selected, access to which
is available to every user anywhere in the world. The objects of
ownership are sections of celestial GEO-space where you can make
unique celestial constellations. All sections are arranged in such a way
that they can be improved, monetized, sold, transferred and used to
obtain new crypto-elements in the system. Made on the parts of the
constellations you can see in the real world, being close to the places
of their actual location, with the help of mobile applications Asterisma.
